    "## Homework 3 Part Two: Scraping\n",
    "This homework asks you to scrape from three different sources: Supreme Court Decisions, rev.com transcripts, and a more complicated version of Shakespeare (bonus (yay, Shakespeare!!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the instructions and do the best you can. Look at the tutorial for examples, my answers for Homework 3 Part One, as well as the Beautiful Soup documentation, and any other Python resource (such as Stack overflow). As you get further into this assignment a lot of the trick will be using loops properly and appending information into lists. One of the great ways to carefully use Beautiful Soup is to first use find() to find the first instance of something and search through it. And then use find_all() to get a list of results that you must then loop through and search within.\n",

    "Now it's time to scrape from reality. The Supreme Court posts its decisions in a format that is not immediately data friendly. They have a simple HTML table with some information about the decision, including a link to a PDF that contains the written decision. We won't mess with those PDFs this week, but we do want to transform their tables into something useful to us. \n",

    "Often there is information that is publicly available but not in a format you want it to be in. That is particularly the case with transcripts.

We are going to start by extracting the dialogue of the transcript from the HTML for Frances Haugen's Senate testimony.\n",

    "**Please note here:** this is the first time I have assigned scraping from the site. Because it is a commercial site, it is possible that they might have protocols that try to defy/block scraping. I was able to download the HTML for all of the pages that we need to scrape below with no problem. Once all 18 of you begin trying to scrape these pages, their site might take notice, or it might not. More importantly, **be careful about how many times you actually run your cell that excutes the actual request.** As I discussed in class, when you have completed a request for an HTML page, save the HTML file locally. And then never run the request again (if you are scraping pages that are being continually updated that is not an option, but here is it). If you need to take a break and come back to your work, make sure to load in the local HTML file that you have downloaded and not to run request again. For the final multi-page scrape it won't make much sense to do that, but you still could. (I don't anticipate there being a problem for this site. But I have found many coders who are new to scraping run requests over and over way too many times and do eventually get blocked by the site, so it is always something to keep in mind when you are scraping a site. And please DO NOT select \"run all cells\", unless you have successfully requested and saved a page local and then commented out the request. Be careful about running all cells generally--especially while you are first building you code.)"

Facebook exploited teens using powerful algorithms that amplified their insecurities and abuses through what it found was an addict’s narrative. There is a question, which I hope you will discuss, as to whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm. Facebook saw teens creating secret accounts that are often hidden from their parents as unique value proposition. In their words, a unique value proposition. A way to drive out numbers for advertisers and shareholders at the expense of safety, and it doubled down on targeting children pushing products on pre-teens not just teens, but pre-teens that it knows are harmful to our kids’ mental health and wellbeing.\n",

Well, this research is the very definition of a bombshell. Facebook and big tech are facing a big tobacco moment, a moment of reckoning, the parallel is striking. I sued big tobacco as Connecticut’s attorney general, I helped to lead the states in that legal action and I remember very, very well, the moment in the course of our litigation when we learned of those files that showed not only that big tobacco knew that its product caused cancer but that they had done the research, they concealed the files, and now we knew and the world knew. And big tech now faces that big tobacco jaw dropping moment of truth. It is documented proof that Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children.

In order to hook us, Instagram uses our private information to precisely target us with content and recommendations, assessing that what will provoke a reaction will keep us scrolling. Far too often these recommendations encouraged are most destructive and dangerous behaviors. As we showed on Thursday, we created a fake account, my office and I did, as a teen interested in extreme dieting and eating disorders. Instagram latched onto that teenager’s initial insecurities it then push more content and recommendations, glorifying eating disorders. That’s how Instagram’s algorithms can push teens into darker and darker places. Facebook’s own researchers called it Instagram’s, “Perfect storm.” exacerbating downward spirals.\n",

That will be a focus of our subcommittee moving forward, and it will continue to be bipartisan. And finally, I’ll just end on this note. In the past weeks and days parents have contacted me with their stories, heartbreaking and spine chilling stories about children pushed into eating disorders, bullying online, self injury of the most disturbing kind, and sometimes even taking their lives because of social media. Parents are holding Facebook accountable because of your bravery, Miss Haugen, And we need to hold accountable Facebook and all big tech as well. Again, my thanks to you.

And as the chairman said, privacy and online privacy, passing a federal privacy standard has been long in the works. I filed my first privacy bill when it was in the House back in 2012, and I think that it will be this Congress and this subcommittee that is going to lead the way to online privacy, data security, section 230 reforms. And of course, Senator Klobuchar always wants to talk about antitrust and I have to give a nod Senator Markey is down there. When we were in the House, we were probably two of the only ones who were talking about the need to have a federal privacy standard.\n",

And Mr. Chairman I think it’s important that we look at these as we talk about the setting for this hearing, what we learned last week, what you and I have been learning over the past three years about big tech and Facebook. And here you go, 66% of teen girls on Instagram and 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparisons, this is Facebook’s research. 52% of teen girls who experience negative social comparison on Instagram said it was caused by images related to beauty. Social comparison is worse on Instagram because it is perceived as real life, but based on celebrity standards. Social comparison mimics the grief cycle and includes a downward emotional spiral, encompassing a range of emotions from jealousy to self proclaimed body dysmorphia. Facebook addiction, which Facebook calls, conveniently, problematic use is most severe in teens peeking at age 14.\n",

At least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on post or decreasing their ad revenues. In fact, Facebook is running scared, as they know that in their own words, young adults are active and less engaged on Facebook and that they are running out of teens to add to Instagram. So teens are looking at other platforms like TikTok, and Facebook is only making those changes that add to its users numbers and ultimately its profits, follow the money.\n",

      "                     So what are these changes? Allowing users to create multiple accounts that Facebook does not delete and encouraging teens to create second accounts, they can hide from their parents. They are also studying younger and younger children, as young as eight, so that they can market to them. And while Ms. Davis says that kids below 13 are not allowed on Facebook or Instagram, we know that they are because she told us that they recently had deleted 600,000 accounts from children under age 13. So how do you get that many underage accounts if you aren’t turning a blind eye to them in the first place. And then in order to try to clean it up, you go to delete it and then you say, “Oh, by the way, we just in the last month deleted 600,000 underage accounts.” And speaking of turning a blind eye, Facebook turns a blind eye to user privacy. News broke yesterday that the private data of over 1.5 billion, that’s right, 1. 5 billion Facebook users is being sold on a hacking forum. That’s its biggest data breach to date. Examples like this underscore my strong concerns about Facebook collecting the data of kids and teen and what they are doing with it.\n",

I don’t know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilized democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies. It also means that millions of small businesses weren’t able to reach potential customers and countless photos of new babies weren’t joyously celebrated by family and friends around the world. I believe in the potential of Facebook. We can have social media we enjoy that connects us without tearing apart our democracy, putting our children in danger and sewing ethnic violence around the world. We can do better.\n",

My job has largely focused on algorithmic products like Google Plus Search and recommendation systems like the one that powers the Facebook newsfeed. Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children, for our public safety, our privacy, and for our democracy, and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes. During my time at Facebook, first working as the lead product manager for civic misinformation, and later on counter espionage, I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolve these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats, and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.\n",

It is about Facebook choosing to grow at all costs, becoming an almost trillion dollar company by buying its profits with our safety. During my time at Facebook, I came to realize a devastating truth. Almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside of Facebook. The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world. The documents I have provide to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages. I came forward because I believe that every human being deserves the dignity of the truth. The severity of this crisis, demands that we break out of our previous regulatory frames.\n",

Most tech companies have systems where they can analyze the data that is on their servers. So most of the focus groups I read or that I saw analysis of were around Messenger Kids, which has children on it. And those focus groups appear to be children interacting in person. Often large tech companies use either sourcing agencies that will go and identify people who meet certain demographic criteria, or they will reach out directly based on data on the platform. So for example, on the case of Messenger Kids, maybe you would want to study a child that was an active user and one that was a less active user. You might reach out to some that came from each population.\n",

When their own research found that more than 13% of teen girls say that Instagram made their thoughts of suicide worse, what did they do? They proposed Instagram for kids, which has now been put on pods because of public pressure. When they found out that their algorithms are fostering polarization, misinformation, and hate, that they allowed 99 per of their violent contact to remain unchecked on their platform, including lead up to the January 6th insurrection, what did they do? They now, as we know, Mark Zuckerberg’s going sailing and saying, no apologies. I think the time has come for action, and I think you are the catalyst at action.

I asked her how they estimate the lifetime value of a user for kids who start using their products before they turn 13. She a evaded the question and said, “That’s not the way we think about it.” Is that right? Or is it your experience that face book estimates and puts a value on how much money they get from users in general? I’ll get to kids in a second. Is that a motivating force for them?\n",

And I think the question is always what is the correct way to do it, the right way to do it, consistent with our first amendment right to free speech. This committee doesn’t have jurisdiction over the antitrust issue, that’s the Judiciary Committee and I’m not averse to looking at the monopolistic nature of Facebook, honestly, I think that’s a real issue that needs to be examined and perhaps addressed as well. But at least under this committee’s jurisdiction, there are a couple of things I think we can do. And I have a piece of legislation and Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal are both co-sponsors called the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. And essentially what it would do is give users the options to engage with social media platforms without being manipulated by the secret formulas that essentially dictate the content that you see when you open up an app or log onto a website.\n",

And importantly, in the context we’re talking about today with this hearing with a major big tech whistleblower, the PACT Act would explore the viability of a federal program for big tech employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing inside the companies where they work.

So let me Ms. Haugen, just ask you, we’ve learned from the information that you provided that Facebook conducts what’s called engagement based ranking, which you’ve described as very dangerous. Could you talk about why engagement based ranking is dangerous? And do you think Congress should seek to pass the legislation like the Filter Bubble Transparency Act that would give users the ability to avoid engagement based ranking altogether?\n",

Facebook likes to present things as false choices, like you have to choose between having lots of spam. Let’s say, imagine we ordered our feeds by like on iMessage or there are other forms of, of social media that are chronologically based. They’re going to say, “You’re going to get spammed, you’re not going to enjoy your feed.” The reality is that those experiences have a lot of permutations. There are ways that we can make those experiences where computers don’t regulate what we see, we together socially regulate what we see. But they don’t want us to have that conversation because Facebook knows that when they pick out the content that we focus on using computers, we spend more time on their platform, they make more money.\n",

      "                     I strongly believe, I’ve spent most of my career working on systems like engagement based ranking. When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years in my own work. Engagement based ranking, Facebook says, “We can do it safely because we have AI. The artificial intelligence will find the bad content that we know our engagement based ranking is promoting.” They’ve written blog posts on how they know engagement based rankings dangerous, but the AI, I will save us. Facebook’s own research, says they cannot adequately identify dangerous content. And as a result, those dangerous algorithms that they admit are picking up the extreme sentiments, the division. They can’t protect us from the harms that they know exist in their own system. And so I don’t think it’s just a question of saying, should people have the option of choosing to not be manipulated by their algorithms? I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intent ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content, it is pulling families apart. And in places like Ethiopia, it’s literally fanning ethnic violence. I encourage reform of these platforms, not picking and choosing individual ideas, but instead making the platforms themselves safer, less twitchy, less reactive, less viral, because that’s how we scalably solve these problems.\n",

As we get into this, I want to first read you a quote that I got from Ms. Davis last week. Here’s what she said during her questioning. “When we do ads to young people, there are only three things that an advertiser can target around: age, gender, location. We also prohibit certain ads to young people, including weight-loss ads. We don’t allow tobacco ads at all [meaning to young people]. We don’t allow them to children. We don’t allow them to minors.”\n",

That it was false. TTP noted that TTP had conducted an experiment just last month, and their goal was to run a series of ads that would be targeted to children ages 13 to 17, to users in the United States. Now, I want to emphasize that TTP didn’t end up running these ads. They stopped them from being distributed to users, but Facebook did in fact approve them. As I understand it, Facebook approved them for an audience of up to 9.1 million users, all of whom were teens.\n",

The second graphic displays an ana tip. That is a tip specifically designed to encourage and promote anorexia. It’s on there. Now the language, the ana tip itself independently promotes that. The ad also promotes it in so far as it was suggesting. These are images you ought to look at when you need motivation to be more anorexic, I guess you could say.

Now, obviously I don’t support and TTP does not support these messages, particularly when targeted to impressionable children. Again, just to be clear, TTP did not end up pushing the ads out after receiving Facebook’s approval, but it did in fact receive Facebook’s approval. I think this says something. One could argue that it proves that Facebook is allowing and perhaps facilitating the targeting of harmful adult-themed ads to our nation’s children.\n",

Right? So the idea that 20% of your users could be facing serious mental health issues and that’s not a problem is shocking. I also want to emphasize for people that eating disorders are serious, right? There are going to be women walking around this planet in 60 years with brittle bones because of choices that Facebook made around emphasizing profit today. Or there are going to be women in 20 years who want to have babies who can’t because they’re infertile as a result of eating disorders today. They’re serious.

And unfortunately, in the case of teen girls and things like self harm, they develop these feedback cycles where children are using Instagram as to self-soothe, but then are exposed to more and more content that makes them hate themselves. This is a thing where we can’t say 80% of kids are okay. We need to say how do save all the kids?\n",

In a place like Ethiopia, where they speak six languages, if you have something that focuses on good ideas and bad ideas, those systems don’t work in diverse places.

You might be showing data that is about the content of their post, but not the post itself. There are many ways to structure these data sets that are privacy conscious, and the fact that Facebook has walled off the ability to see even basic things about how the platform performs, or in the case of their past academic research, releasing inaccurate data, or not being clear about how they pulled that data is just part of a pattern of behavior of Facebook hiding behind walls and operating in the shadows.

Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality. Reddit is vaguely about ideas. But Instagram is about bodies and about comparing lifestyles. And so, I think there are real questions where Instagram would have to come in and think hard about their product or about, what is their product about? And I don’t think those answers are immediately obvious, but that’s why I believe we need to solve problems together and not alone, because collaborating with the public will give us better solutions.\n",

These are people who don’t get protections from integrity systems to see what happens to them. And those people who deal with a more toxic, painful version of Facebook use Facebook less. And so, one could reason a kinder, friendlier, more collaborative Facebook might actually have more users five years from now. So it’s in everyone’s interest.\n",

In terms of should people consent to working with algorithms, I worry that if Facebook is allowed to give users the choice of, do you want to an engagement-based newsfeed or do you want a chronological newsfeed? Like ordered by time, maybe a little spam demotion, that people will choose the more addictive option, that engagement based ranking, even if it is leading their daughters to eating disorders.\n",

Some of it’s dark money. Some of it is very overt, but I guess the point I’d like to make to you personally is that your being here really sends a profound message to our nation that one person can really make a difference. One person standing up, speaking out can overcome a lot of those obstacles for us. And you have crystallized, in a way, our consciousness here. You have been a catalyst, I think, for change in a way that we haven’t seen and I’ve been working on these issues for 10, 15 years. And you have raised awareness in a way that I think is very unique. So, thank you not only for your risk-taking and your courage and strength and standing up, but also for the effect that it has had.\n",

There is an active need for schools or maybe the national institutes of health to make established information, where if parents want to learn on how they can support their kids, it should be easy for them to know what is constructive and not constructive. Because Facebook’s own research says kids today feel like they are struggling alone with all these issues, because their parents can’t guide them. And one of the things I’m saddest when I look on Twitter is when people blame the parents for these problems with Facebook. They say, “Just take your kid’s phone away.” And the reality is these issues are a lot more complicated than that. And so, we need to support parents because right now, if Facebook won’t protect the kids, we at least need to help the parents to protect the kids.\n",

It’s so hard to dislodge a ruler like that, that yardstick, that you end up in this situation where, because no one is taking leadership, no one is intentionally designing these systems… It’s just many, many people running in parallel, all moving the metric, that these problems get amplified and amplified and amplified.

And I came to hear from a lot of smokers, how grateful they were, ironically and unexpectedly, that someone was fighting Big Tobacco because they felt they had been victimized as children. They started smoking when they were 7, 8, 12 years old because Big Tobacco was hooking them. And as we develop the research, very methodically and purposefully addicting them at that early age, when they believed that they would make themselves more popular, that they would be cool and hip if they began smoking and then nicotine hooked them. Now, physiologically, nicotine has addictive properties. What is it about Facebook’s tactics of hooking young people that makes it similar to what Big Tobacco has done?\n",

      "                     Facebook’s own research about Instagram contains quotes from kids saying, “I feel bad when I use Instagram, but I also feel like I can’t stop.” Right? “I know that the more time I spend on this, the worse I feel, but I just can’t…” They want the next click. They want the next like. The dopamine, the little hits all the time. And I feel a lot of pain for those kids, right? They say they fear being ostracized if they step away from the platform. So imagine you’re in this situation, you’re in this relationship where every time you open the app, it makes you feel worse, but you also fear isolation if you don’t. I think there’s a huge opportunity here to make social media that makes kids feel good, not feel bad, and that we have an obligation to our youth to make sure that they’re safe online.\n",

In that testimony, you discuss how Facebook generates self-harm and self-hate, especially among vulnerable groups like teenage girls. I happen to be a father of four kids, three daughters, two of whom are teenagers. And as you just alluded to, most adults, myself included, have never been a teenager during the age of Facebook, Instagram, and these other social media platforms. And therefore, I think it can be really hard for many of us to fully appreciate the impact that certain posts may have, including, I would add, on a teen’s mental health. So can you discuss the short and long-term consequences of body image issues on these platforms, please?\n",

I’m very scared about the upcoming generation because when you and I interact in person, and I say something mean to you, and I see wince or I see you cry, that makes me less likely to do it the next time, right? That’s a feedback cycle. Online kids don’t get those cues and they learn to be incredibly cruel to each other and they normalize it. And I’m scared of what will their lives look like, where they grow up with the idea that it’s okay to be treated badly by people who allegedly care about them? That’s a scary future.\n",

There are these things called power laws. It means that a small number of users are extremely intensely engaged on any given topic and most people are just lightly engaged.

So, the problems here are about the design of algorithms of AI, and the idea that AI is not intelligent. And if you break up Instagram and Facebook from each other, it’s likely… So I used to work on Pinterest. And the thing that we faced from a business model perspective was that advertisers didn’t want to learn multiple advertising platforms, that they got one platform for Instagram and Facebook and whatever, and learning a second one for Pinterest, Pinterest made radically fewer dollars per user. And when I’m of is, right now, Facebook is the internet for lots of the world. If you go to Africa, the internet is Facebook. If you split Facebook and Instagram apart, it’s likely that most advertising dollars will go to Instagram, and Facebook will continue to be this Frankenstein that is altering that is endangering lives around the world. Only, now there won’t be money to fund it. And so, I think oversight and finding collaborative solutions with Congress is going to be key, because these systems are going to continue to exist and be dangerous, even if broken up.\n",

It says, “Just pointing out the fact that Francis Haugen did not work on child safety or Instagram, or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook.” So I will simply say this to Mr. Stone: if Facebook wants to discuss their targeting of children, if they want to discuss their practices, privacy invasion, or violations of the Children Online Privacy Act, I am extending to you an invitation to step forward, be sworn in, and testify before this committee, we would be pleased to hear from you and welcome your testimony.\n",

Last week, YouTube announced it was swiftly banning all anti-vaccine misinformation, and I have long called on Facebook to take similar steps. They’ve taken some steps, but do you think they can remove this content and do they put sufficient resources? We know the effect of this. We know that over half the people that haven’t gotten the vaccines it’s because of something that they’ve seen on social media. I know the guy I walked into a cafe and said his mother-in-law wouldn’t get a vaccine because she thought a microchip would be planted in her arm, which is false. I’m just saying that for the record here, in case it gets put on social media. Could you talk about, are there enough resources to stop this from happening?\n",

As early as 2012, Facebook has wanted to allow children under the age of 12 to use this platform. At that time in 2012, I wrote a letter to Facebook asking questions about what data it planned to collect, and whether the company intended to serve targeted ads at children. Now, here we are nine years later, debating the very same issues. Today, Ms. Haugen, you’ve made it abundantly clear why Facebook wants to bring more children onto the platform. It’s to hook them early, just like cigarettes so that they become lifelong users, so Facebook’s profits increase. Yet, we should also ask why in the last nine years as the company not launch Facebook for kids or Instagram for kids? After all, from the testimony here today, Facebook appears to act without regard to any moral code, or any conscience, or instead puts profit above people, profit above all else.\n",

Well, it says to all the television networks in America, “Stop praying on children. Stop using all of your power in order to try to get young children in our country, hooked on the products that are going to be sold.” We had to pass a law to ban television stations from doing this. That’s why I knew that after my law passed in 1996, to break up the monopolies of the telecommunications industry and allow in the Googles, and the Facebooks, and all the other companies, you name it, that we would need a child privacy protection there, because everyone would just move over to that new venue. It was pretty obvious, and of course the industry said, “No way, we’re going to have privacy laws for adults.” And they blocked me from putting that on the books in 1996. But at least for children, I got up to age 12. That’s all I could get out of the industry.\n",

The research I’ve seen with regard to quantifiable popularity is that, as long as comments are allowed, so this is not a quantitative thing, this is just comments, as long as comments are still on posts on Instagram, just taking likes off Instagram, doesn’t fix the social comparison problem. That teenage girls are smart, they see that Sally is prettier than them, her pictures are really good, she gets tons of comments, they don’t get very many comments. Right?

When I was a boy, and the salesman would knock on the front door, my mother would just say, “Tell them I’m not home. That man is not getting into our living room.” Well, I would say to my mother, “But you are home.” “Not to him,” she would say. Well, we need to give parents the ability just to say, “No one’s home for you, and your company, and your attempts to prey upon children, to get into our living room.” That’s our moment in history.

I’ve been very pleased and honored to work with him on legislation now, going forward. And I joined him in thanking you. I have just a few concluding questions, and I seem to be the last one left standing here. So, the good news is I don’t think we’ll have others, but as you may know, you do know, my office created an Instagram user identified as a 13 year old girl. She followed a few easily identifiable accounts on weight loss, dieting, eating disorders. And she was deluged, literally, within a day of content, pushed to her by algorithms that, in effect, promoted self injury and eating disorders. Are you surprised by that fact?\n",

      "                     I just received by text, literally about 15 minutes ago, a message from someone in Connecticut. And I’m going to read it to you. It’s from a dad, “I’m in tears right now, watching your interaction with Francis Haugen. My 15 year old daughter loved her body at 14. Was on Instagram constantly, and maybe posting too much. Suddenly, she started hating her body, her body dysmorphia, now anorexia, and was in deep, deep trouble before we found treatment. I fear she’ll never be the same, I’m brokenhearted. I think people tend to lose sight of the real world impact here. And I think that’s the reason that you’re here. I’d just like to invite you, if you have any words to those other employees at big tech, the workers who may be troubled by the misconduct or unethical conduct that they see, what you would tell them.\n",

      "                     We live in a pattern that we have seen throughout time with regard to technologies, is that humans are very crafty people; we find interesting solutions, but we often get out over our skis, right? We develop things that are of larger scale than we really know how to handle. And what we have done in the past is, when we see this happen, we take a step back, and we find institutions, and we find frameworks for doing these things in a safe way. We live in a moment where whistleblowers are very important, because these technological systems are walled off. They are very complicated. They’re things that you need to be a specialist to really understand the consequences of. And the fact that we’ve been having the exact same kinds of false choice discussions about what to do about Facebook; is it about privacy or oversight? Is it about censorship or safety? The fact that we’re being asked these false choices is just an illustration of what happens when the real solutions are hidden inside of companies. We need more tech employees to forward through legitimate channels, like the SCC or Congress, to make sure that the public has the information they need, in order to have technologies be human-centric, not computer-centric.\n",

Feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, rejection and self hatred, will impact this generation for years to come. Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking at themselves in the mirror, feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror today. And yet rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing. His new modus operandi, no apologies, no admission, no action, nothing to see here. Mark Zuckerberg you need to come before this committee need to explain to Frances Haugen, to us, to the world and to the parents of America, what you were doing and why you did it.###################\n",

      "Instagram’s business model is pretty straightforward, more eyeballs, more dollars. Everything Facebook does is to add more users and keep them on their apps for longer. In order to hook us, Instagram uses our private information to precisely target us with content and recommendations, assessing that what will provoke a reaction will keep us scrolling. Far too often these recommendations encouraged are most destructive and dangerous behaviors. As we showed on Thursday, we created a fake account, my office and I did, as a teen interested in extreme dieting and eating disorders. Instagram latched onto that teenager’s initial insecurities it then push more content and recommendations, glorifying eating disorders. That’s how Instagram’s algorithms can push teens into darker and darker places. Facebook’s own researchers called it Instagram’s, “Perfect storm.” exacerbating downward spirals.###################\n",

      "Facebook, as you have put it, Miss Haugen, so powerfully, maximizes profits and ignores pain. Facebook’s failure to acknowledge and to act makes it morally bankrupt. Again and again Facebook rejected reforms recommended by its own researchers. Last week, Ms. Davis said, “We’re looking at it.” No specific plans, no commitments, only vague platitudes.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 10:54 text: \n",
      "These documents that you have revealed provided this company with a blueprint for reform, provided specific recommendation that could have made Facebook and Instagram safer. The company repeatedly ignored those recommendations from its own researchers that would’ve made Facebook and Instagram safer. Facebook researchers have suggested changing their recommendations to stop promoting accounts known to encourage dangerous body comparison. Instead of making meaningful changes, Facebook simply pays lip service and if they won’t act and big tech won’t act, Congress has to intervene. Privacy protection is long overdue Senator Markey and I have introduced the Kids Act, which would ban addictive tactics that Facebook uses to exploit children. Parents deserve better tools to protect their children. I’m also a firm supporter of reforming section 230, we should consider narrowing this sweeping immunity when platform’s algorithm amplify illegal conduct, you’ve commented on this in your testimony, and perhaps you’ll expand on it.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 12:21 text: \n",
      "We have also heard compelling recommendations about requiring disclosures of research and independent reviews of these platforms’ algorithms. And I plan to pursue these ideas. The Securities and Exchange Commission should investigate your contentions and claims Miss Haugen, and so should the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook appears to have misled the public and investors, and if that’s correct it ought to face real penalties as result of that misleading and deceptive misrepresentation. I want to thank all my colleagues who are here today, because what we have is a bipartisan congressional roadmap for reform that will safeguard and protect children from big tech. That will be a focus of our subcommittee moving forward, and it will continue to be bipartisan. And finally, I’ll just end on this note. In the past weeks and days parents have contacted me with their stories, heartbreaking and spine chilling stories about children pushed into eating disorders, bullying online, self injury of the most disturbing kind, and sometimes even taking their lives because of social media. Parents are holding Facebook accountable because of your bravery, Miss Haugen, And we need to hold accountable Facebook and all big tech as well. Again, my thanks to you. I am going to enter into the record a letter from 52 state Attorneys General and from two members of the Youth Advisory Board of Sandy Hook, promise as long as there’s no objection.

Good morning to everyone, it is nice to see people in this hearing room and to be here for the today. Miss Haugen, We thank you for your appearance before us today and for giving the opportunity, not only for Congress but for the American people to hear from you in this setting, and we appreciate that.###################\n",

      "Mr. Chairman, I think, also thanks to you and your staff that have worked with our team to make certain that we had this hearing and this opportunity today that we can get more insight into what Facebook is actually doing as they invade the privacy, not only of adults, but of children and look at the ways that they are in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which is federal law and looking at how they are evading that law and working around it. And as the chairman said, privacy and online privacy, passing a federal privacy standard has been long in the works. I filed my first privacy bill when it was in the House back in 2012, and I think that it will be this Congress and this subcommittee that is going to lead the way to online privacy, data security, section 230 reforms. And of course, Senator Klobuchar always wants to talk about antitrust and I have to give a nod Senator Markey is down there. When we were in the House, we were probably two of the only ones who were talking about the need to have a federal privacy standard.###################\n",

      "Now, as the Chairman mentioned, last week we heard from Mrs. Davis who heads global safety for Facebook. And it was surprising to us that what she tried to do was to minimize the information that was in these documents, to minimize the research and to minimize the knowledge that Facebook had. One point I even reminded her, the research was not third party research, the research was there, Facebook’s internal research. So they knew what they were doing, they knew where the violations were and they know they are guilty. They know this. Their research tells them this.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Blackburn: time: 17:24 text: \n",
      "Last week in advance of our hearing, Facebook released two studies and said that the Wall Street Journal was all wrong, that they had just gotten it wrong. As if the Wall Street Journal did not know how to read these documents and how to work through this research. Having seen the data that you’ve presented and the other studies that Facebook did not publicly share, I feel pretty confident that it’s Facebook who has done the misrepresenting to this committee.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Blackburn: time: 18:03 text: \n",
      "Here are some of the numbers that Facebook chose not to share. And Mr. Chairman I think it’s important that we look at these as we talk about the setting for this hearing, what we learned last week, what you and I have been learning over the past three years about big tech and Facebook. And here you go, 66% of teen girls on Instagram and 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparisons, this is Facebook’s research. 52% of teen girls who experience negative social comparison on Instagram said it was caused by images related to beauty. Social comparison is worse on Instagram because it is perceived as real life, but based on celebrity standards. Social comparison mimics the grief cycle and includes a downward emotional spiral, encompassing a range of emotions from jealousy to self proclaimed body dysmorphia. Facebook addiction, which Facebook calls, conveniently, problematic use is most severe in teens peeking at age 14.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Blackburn: time: 19:24 text: \n",
      "Here’s what else we know. Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids’ safety on their platforms. At least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on post or decreasing their ad revenues. In fact, Facebook is running scared, as they know that in their own words, young adults are active and less engaged on Facebook and that they are running out of teens to add to Instagram. So teens are looking at other platforms like TikTok, and Facebook is only making those changes that add to its users numbers and ultimately its profits, follow the money.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Blackburn: time: 20:13 text: \n",
      "So what are these changes? Allowing users to create multiple accounts that Facebook does not delete and encouraging teens to create second accounts, they can hide from their parents. They are also studying younger and younger children, as young as eight, so that they can market to them. And while Ms. Davis says that kids below 13 are not allowed on Facebook or Instagram, we know that they are because she told us that they recently had deleted 600,000 accounts from children under age 13. So how do you get that many underage accounts if you aren’t turning a blind eye to them in the first place. And then in order to try to clean it up, you go to delete it and then you say, “Oh, by the way, we just in the last month deleted 600,000 underage accounts.” And speaking of turning a blind eye, Facebook turns a blind eye to user privacy. News broke yesterday that the private data of over 1.5 billion, that’s right, 1. 5 billion Facebook users is being sold on a hacking forum. That’s its biggest data breach to date. Examples like this underscore my strong concerns about Facebook collecting the data of kids and teen and what they are doing with it.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Blackburn: time: 21:49 text: \n",
      "Facebook also turns a blind eye toward blatant human exploitation. Taking place on its platform trafficking, forced labor, cartels, the worst possible things one can imagine. Big tech companies have gotten away with abusing consumers for too long, it is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the wellbeing of children and all users. So as a mother and a grandmother, this is an issue that is of particular concern to me. So we thank you being here today, Miss Haugen. And we look forward to getting to the truth about what Facebook is doing with users’ data and how they are abusing their privacy and how they show a lack of respect for the individuals that are on their network. We look forward to the testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.###################\n",

      "If you don’t mind, thank you, Chairman Blumenthal, and I will just take a moment or two, and I do appreciate being able to speak. As ranking member of the full committee, Miss Haugen, this is a subcommittee hearing, you see some vacant seats, this is pretty good attendance for our subcommittee. There are also a lot of things going on, so people will be coming it going, but I’m willing to predict that this will have almost 100% attendance by members of the subcommittee because of the importance of this subject matter. So thanks for coming forward to share concerns about Facebook’s business practices, particularly with respect to children and teens. And of course, that is the main topic, it’s the title of our hearing today, protecting kids online.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Wicker: time: 23:52 text: \n",
      "The recent revelations about Facebook’s mental health effects on children and it’s plan to target younger audiences are indeed disturbing. And I think you’re going to see a lot of bipartisan concern about this today and in future hearings. They show how urgent it is for Congress to act against powerful tech companies on behalf of children and the broader public. And I say powerful tech companies, they are possessive of immense, immense power. Their product is addictive and people on both sides of this dias are concerned about this.###################\n",
      "speaker: Ranking Member Senator Wicker: time: 24:42 text: \n",
      "I talk to an opinion maker just down the hall a few moments before this hearing, this person said the tech gods have been demystified now. And I think this hearing today, Mr. Chair, is a part of the process of demystifying big tech. The children of America are hooked on their product, it is often destructive and harmful, and there is a cynical knowledge on behalf of the leadership of these big tech companies that that is true. Miss Haugen, I hope you will have a chance to talk about your work experience at Facebook and perhaps compare it to other social media companies. Also, look forward to hearing your thoughts on how this committee and how this Congress can ensure greater accountability and transparency, especially with regard to children.

      "Good afternoon. Chairman Blumenthal, Ranking Member Blackburn, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you. My name is Francis Haugen, I used to work at Facebook. I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us. But I am here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy. The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed. They won’t solve this crisis without your help.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 27:28 text: \n",
      "Yesterday, we saw Facebook get taken off the internet. I don’t know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilized democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies. It also means that millions of small businesses weren’t able to reach potential customers and countless photos of new babies weren’t joyously celebrated by family and friends around the world. I believe in the potential of Facebook. We can have social media we enjoy that connects us without tearing apart our democracy, putting our children in danger and sewing ethnic violence around the world. We can do better.###################\n",

      "I have worked as a product manager at large tech companies since 2006, including Google, Pinterest, Yelp, and Facebook. My job has largely focused on algorithmic products like Google Plus Search and recommendation systems like the one that powers the Facebook newsfeed. Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children, for our public safety, our privacy, and for our democracy, and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes. During my time at Facebook, first working as the lead product manager for civic misinformation, and later on counter espionage, I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolve these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats, and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 29:25 text: \n",
      "This is not simply a matter of certain social media users being angry or unstable, or about one side being radicalized against the other. It is about Facebook choosing to grow at all costs, becoming an almost trillion dollar company by buying its profits with our safety. During my time at Facebook, I came to realize a devastating truth. Almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside of Facebook. The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world. The documents I have provide to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages. I came forward because I believe that every human being deserves the dignity of the truth. The severity of this crisis, demands that we break out of our previous regulatory frames.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 30:28 text: \n",
      "Facebook wants to trick you into thinking that privacy protections or changes to section 230 alone will be sufficient. While important, these will not get to the core of the issue, which is that no one truly understands the destructive choices made by Facebook except Facebook. We can afford nothing less than full transparency. As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable. Until the incentives change Facebook will not change. Left alone Facebook will continue to make choices that go against the common good, our common good.###################\n",

      "Today Facebook shapes our perception of the world by choosing the information we see. Even those who don’t use Facebook are impacted by the majority who do. A company with such frightening influence over so many people, over their deepest thoughts, feelings and behavior, needs real over for site. But Facebook’s closed design means it has no real oversight. Only Facebook knows how it personalizes your feed for you. At other large tech companies like Google, any independent researcher can download from the internet, the company search results and write papers about what they find, and they do. But Facebook hides behind walls that keeps researchers and regulators from understanding the true dynamics of their system. Facebook will tell you, privacy means they can’t give you data. This is not true.###################\n",

      "When tobacco companies claimed that filtered cigarettes were safer for consumers, scientists could independently invalidate these marketing messages and confirm that, in fact, they posed a greater threat to human health. The public cannot do the same with Facebook. We are given no other option than to take their marketing messages on blind faith. Not only does the company hide most of its own data, my disclosure has proved that when Facebook is directly asked questions as important as, how do you impact the health and safety of our children, they choose to mislead and misdirect. Facebook has not earned our blind faith.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 33:07 text: \n",
      "This inability to see into Facebook’s actual systems and confirm that they work as communicated is like the department of transportation regulating cars by only watching them drive down the highway. Today, no regulator has a menu of solutions for how to fix Facebook, because Facebook didn’t want them to know enough about what’s causing the problems, otherwise there wouldn’t have been need for a whistle blower. How is the public supposed to assess if Facebook is resolving conflicts of interest in a way that is aligned with the public good, if the public has no visibility into how Facebook operates. This must change.###################\n",

      "Facebook wants you to believe that the problems we’re talking about are unsolvable. They want you to believe in false choices. They want you to believe that you must choose between a Facebook full of divisive and extreme content, or losing one of the most important values our country was founded upon, free speech. That you must choose between public oversight of Facebook’s choices and your personal privacy. That to be able to share fun photos of your kids with old friends, you must also be inundated with anger driven virality. They want you to believe that this is just part of the deal. I am here today to tell you that’s not true. These problems are solvable. A safer, free speech respecting, more enjoyable social media is possible, but there is one thing that I hope everyone takes away from these disclosures. It is that Facebook can change, but is clearly not going to do so on its own. My fear is that without action, divisive and extremist behaviors we see today are only the beginning.

And we’ve made that I think very clear in the course of these proceedings. I want to ask you about this idea of disclosure. You’ve talked about looking in effect at a car going down the road, and we’re going to have five minute rounds of questions, maybe a second round if you are willing to do it. We’re here today to look under the hood and that’s what we need to do more. In August Senator Blackburn and I wrote to Mark Zuckerberg and we asked him pretty straightforward questions about how the company works and safeguards children and teens on Instagram, Facebook dodged, ducked, sidetracked, in effect misled us. So I’m going to ask you a few straightforward questions to break down some of what you have said, and if you can answer them yes or no, that would be great.

      "Facebook has studied a pattern that they call problematic use, what we might more commonly call addiction. It has a very high bar for what it believes it is. It says you self-identify that you don’t have control over your usage and that it is materially harming your health, your schoolwork or your physical health. Five to 6% of 14 year olds have the self-awareness to admit both those questions. It is likely that far more than five to 6% of 14 year olds are addicted to Instagram.###################\n",

And she said, “There’s no one person who makes a decision like that. We think about that collaboratively.” It’s as though she couldn’t mention Mark Zuckerberg’s name.

      "There is a cycle occurring inside the company where Facebook has struggled for a long time to recruit and retain the number of employees it needs to tackle the large scope of projects that is chosen to take on. Facebook is stuck in a cycle where it struggles to hire, that causes it to understaff projects, which causes scandals, which then makes it harder to hire. Part of why Facebook needs to come out and say, “We did something wrong. We made some choices that we regret.” Is the only way we can move forward and heal. Facebook is we first have to admit the truth. The way we’ll have reconciliation and we can move forward is by first being honest and declaring moral bankruptcy.###################\n",

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 41:44 text: \n",
      "I don’t think at any point Facebook set out to make a destructive platform.

And as a result, regularly integrity actions, projects that were hard fought by the teams trying to keep us safe are undone by new growth projects that counteract those same remedies.

I want to stay with Ms. Davis and some of her comments, because I had asked her last week about the underage users and she had made the comment, I’m going to quote from her testimony, “If we find an account of someone who’s under 13, we remove them. In the last three months, we removed 600,000 accounts of under 13 year olds.” And I have to tell you, it seems to me that there’s a problem if you have 600,000 accounts from children who ought not to be there in the first place. So what did Mark Zuckerberg know about Facebook’s plans to bring kids on as new users and advertise to them?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 44:30 text: \n",
      "There are reports within Facebook that show cohort analysis were where they examine at what ages do people join Facebook and Instagram. And based on those cohort analyses, so Facebook likes to say children lie about their ages to get onto the platform. The reality is enough kids tell the truth that you can work backwards to figure out what a are approximately the real ages of anyone who’s on the platform. When Facebook does cohort analyses and looks back retrospectively, it discovers things like up to 10 to 15% of even 10 year olds in a given cohort may be on Facebook or Instagram.###################\n",

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 45:32 text: \n",
      "A pattern of behavior that I saw at Facebook was that often problems were so understaffed that there was kind of an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems. So for example, my last team at Facebook was on the counter espionage team within the threat intelligence org. And at any given time, our team could only handle a third of the cases that we knew about. We knew that if we built E even a basic detector, we would likely have many more cases.###################\n",

      "Yeah. Let me ask you this. So you look at the way that they have the data, but they’re choosing to keep that data and advertise from it, right? And sell it to third parties. So what does FA Facebook do? You’ve got these 600,000 accounts that ought not to be on there.###################\n",

Since, as you’re saying, they can work backward and figure out the true age of a user. So what do they do with it? Do they delete it? Do they store it? Do they keep it? How do they process that?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 46:59 text: \n",
      "My understanding of Facebook’s data retention policies, and I want to be really clear: I didn’t work directly on that, is that when they delete an account, they delete all the data of it in, I believe 90 days in compliance with GDPR. With regard to children underage on the platform, Facebook could do substantially more to detect more of those children and they should have to publish for Congress, those processes, because there are lots of subtleties and those things, and they could be much more effective than probably what they’re doing today.###################\n",

I want you to tell me how Facebook is able to do market research on these children that are under age 13, because Ms. Davis, she didn’t deny this last week. So how are they doing this? Do they bring kids into focus groups with their parents? How do they get that permission? She said, they got permission from parents. Is there a permission slip or a form that gets signed? And then how do they know which kids to target?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 48:20 text: \n",
      "There’s a bunch to unpack there. We’ll start with maybe how did they recruit children for focus groups, or recruit teenagers. Most tech companies have systems where they can analyze the data that is on their servers. So most of the focus groups I read or that I saw analysis of were around Messenger Kids, which has children on it. And those focus groups appear to be children interacting in person. Often large tech companies use either sourcing agencies that will go and identify people who meet certain demographic criteria, or they will reach out directly based on data on the platform. So for example, on the case of Messenger Kids, maybe you would want to study a child that was an active user and one that was a less active user. You might reach out to some that came from each population.###################\n",

When their own research found that more than 13% of teen girls say that Instagram made their thoughts of suicide worse, what did they do? They proposed Instagram for kids, which has now been put on pods because of public pressure. When they found out that their algorithms are fostering polarization, misinformation, and hate, that they allowed 99 per of their violent contact to remain unchecked on their platform, including lead up to the January 6th insurrection, what did they do? They now, as we know, Mark Zuckerberg’s going sailing and saying, no apologies. I think the time has come for action, and I think you are the catalyst at action. You have said privacy legislation is not enough. I completely agree with you.###################\n",

      "But I think you know, we have not done anything to update our privacy laws in this country, our federal privacy laws, nothing, zilch in any major way. Why? Because there are lobbyists around every single corner of this building that have been hired by the tech industry. We have done nothing when it comes to making the algorithms more transparent, allowing for the university research that you refer to. Why? Because Facebook and the other tech companies are throwing a bunch of money around this town and people are listening to that. We have done nothing significantly past, although we are on a bipartisan basis, working in the Antitrust Subcommittee to get something done on consolidation, which you understand allows the dominant platforms to control all this like the bullies in the neighborhood, buy out the companies that maybe could have competed with them and added the bells and whistles.###################\n",

      "So the time for action is now. So I’ll start with something that I asked Facebook’s head of safety when she testified before us last week. I asked her how they estimate the lifetime value of a user for kids who start using their products before they turn 13. She a evaded the question and said, “That’s not the way we think about it.” Is that right? Or is it your experience that face book estimates and puts a value on how much money they get from users in general? I’ll get to kids in a second. Is that a motivating force for them?###################\n",

So one of the things disclosed in the Wall Street Journal was that I believe it’s like 87% of all the misinformation spending is spent on English, but only about like 9% of the users are English speakers. It seems that Facebook invests more in users who make them more money, even though the danger may not be evenly distributed based on profitability.###################\n",

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 52:39 text: \n",
      "Facebook’s internal documents talk about the importance of getting younger users, for example, tweens onto Instagram, like Instagram Kids, because they know that children bring their parents online and things like that.

      "speaker: Senator Klobuchar: time: 52:58 text: \n",
      "Facebook reported advertising revenue to be $51 and 58 cents per user last quarter in the US and Canada. When I asked Ms. Davis, how much of that came from Instagram users under 18, she wouldn’t say. Do you think that teens are profitable for their company?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 53:16 text: \n",
      "I would assume so. Based on advertising for things like television, you get much substantially higher advertising rates for customers who don’t yet have preferences or habits.

      "speaker: Senator Klobuchar: time: 53:30 text: \n",
      "Another major issue that’s come out of this, eating disorders. Studies have found that eating disorders actually have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness for women. And I led a bill on this with Senators Capito and Baldwin that we passed into law, and I’m concerned that this algorithms that they have pushes outrageous content, promoting anorexia and the like.

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 54:02 text: \n",
      "Facebook knows that their engagement based ranking, the way that they pick the content in Instagram for young users, for all users, amplifies preferences. And they have done something called a proactive incident response where they take things that they’ve heard, for example, can you be led by the algorithms to anorexia content? And they have literally recreated that experiment themselves and confirmed, yes, this happens to people. So Facebook know that they are leading young users to anorexia content.###################\n",

On 60 Minutes, you said that Facebook implemented safeguards to reduce misinformation ahead of the 2020 election, but turned off those safeguards right after the election, and you know that the insurrection occurred January 6th.

The choices that were happening on the platform were really about how reactive and twitchy was the platform, how viral was the platform? And Facebook changed those safety defaults in the run up to the election because they knew they were dangerous. And because they wanted that growth back, they wanted the acceleration of the platform back after the election, they returned to their original defaults, and the fact that they had to break the glass on January 6th and turn them back on, I think that’s deeply problematic.###################\n",

      "Thank you Mr. Chair and ranking member Blackburn. I’ve been arguing for some time that it is time for Congress to act. And I think the question is always what is the correct way to do it, the right way to do it, consistent with our first amendment right to free speech. This committee doesn’t have jurisdiction over the antitrust issue, that’s the Judiciary Committee and I’m not averse to looking at the monopolistic nature of Facebook, honestly, I think that’s a real issue that needs to be examined and perhaps addressed as well. But at least under this committee’s jurisdiction, there are a couple of things I think we can do. And I have a piece of legislation and Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal are both co-sponsors called the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. And essentially what it would do is give users the options to engage with social media platforms without being manipulated by the secret formulas that essentially dictate the content that you see when you open up an app or log onto a website.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Thune: time: 57:14 text: \n",
      "We also, I think, need to hold big tech accountable by reforming Section 230 and one of the best opportunities I think to do that, at least in a bipartisan way is the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency or the PACT Act, and that’s legislation of knife cosponsored with Senator Schatz, which in addition to stripping Section 230 protections for content that a court determines to be illegal, the PACT Act would also increase transparency and due process for users around the content moderation process. And importantly, in the context we’re talking about today with this hearing with a major big tech whistleblower, the PACT Act would explore the viability of a federal program for big tech employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing inside the companies where they work. And in my view, we should encourage employees in the tech sector like you to speak up about questionable practices of big tech companies.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Thune: time: 58:07 text: \n",
      "So we can, among other things, ensure that Americans are fully aware of how social media platforms are using artificial intelligence and opaque algorithms to keep them hooked on the platform. So let me Ms. Haugen, just ask you, we’ve learned from the information that you provided that Facebook conducts what’s called engagement based ranking, which you’ve described as very dangerous. Could you talk about why engagement based ranking is dangerous? And do you think Congress should seek to pass the legislation like the Filter Bubble Transparency Act that would give users the ability to avoid engagement based ranking altogether?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 58:45 text: \n",
      "Facebook is going to say, “You don’t want to give up engagement based ranking. You’re not going to like Facebook as much if we’re not picking out the content for you.” That’s just not true. Facebook likes to present things as false choices, like you have to choose between having lots of spam. Let’s say, imagine we ordered our feeds by like on iMessage or there are other forms of, of social media that are chronologically based. They’re going to say, “You’re going to get spammed, you’re not going to enjoy your feed.” The reality is that those experiences have a lot of permutations. There are ways that we can make those experiences where computers don’t regulate what we see, we together socially regulate what we see. But they don’t want us to have that conversation because Facebook knows that when they pick out the content that we focus on using computers, we spend more time on their platform, they make more money.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 59:42 text: \n",
      "The dangers of engagement based ranking are that Facebook knows that content that elicits an extreme reaction from you is more likely to get a click, a comment or reshare. And it’s interesting because those clicks and comments and reshares aren’t even necessarily for your benefit, it’s because they know that other people will produce more content if they get the likes and comments and reshares. They prioritize content in your feed so that you will give little hits of dopamine to your friends, so they will create more content. And they have run experiments on people, producer side experiments, where they have confirmed this.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Thune: time: 01:00:19 text: \n",
      "So you and part of the information you provided the wall street journal, it’s been found that Facebook altered its algorithm in an attempt to boost these meaningful social interactions or MSI. But rather than strengthening bonds between family and friends on the platform, the algorithm instead rewarded more outrage and sensationalism. And I think Facebook would say that it’s algorithms are used to connect individuals with other friends and family that are largely positive. Do you believe that Facebook’s algorithms make its platform a better place for most users and should consumers have the option to use Facebook and Instagram without being manipulated by algorithms designed to keep them engaged on that platform?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 01:01:02 text: \n",
      "I strongly believe, I’ve spent most of my career working on systems like engagement based ranking. When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years in my own work. Engagement based ranking, Facebook says, “We can do it safely because we have AI. The artificial intelligence will find the bad content that we know our engagement based ranking is promoting.” They’ve written blog posts on how they know engagement based rankings dangerous, but the AI, I will save us. Facebook’s own research, says they cannot adequately identify dangerous content. And as a result, those dangerous algorithms that they admit are picking up the extreme sentiments, the division. They can’t protect us from the harms that they know exist in their own system. And so I don’t think it’s just a question of saying, should people have the option of choosing to not be manipulated by their algorithms? I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intent ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content, it is pulling families apart. And in places like Ethiopia, it’s literally fanning ethnic violence. I encourage reform of these platforms, not picking and choosing individual ideas, but instead making the platforms themselves safer, less twitchy, less reactive, less viral, because that’s how we scalably solve these problems.###################\n",

And I would immediately implement the, “Soft interventions,” that were identified to protect the 2020. So that’s things like requiring someone to click on a link before resharing it, because other companies like Twitter have found that that significantly reduces misinformation.

      "Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Haugen, for joining us this week. It’s very, very helpful. We’re grateful that you’re willing to make yourself available. Last week we had another witness from Facebook, Ms. Davis. She came, and she testified before this committee, and she focused on, among other things, the extent to which Facebook targets ads to children, including ads that are either sexually suggestive or geared toward adult-themed products or themes in general.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:20:46 text: \n",
      "Now, while I appreciated her willingness to be here, I didn’t get the clearest answers in response to some of those questions, and so I’m hoping that you can help shed some light on some of those issues related to Facebook’s advertising processes here today. As we get into this, I want to first read you a quote that I got from Ms. Davis last week. Here’s what she said during her questioning. “When we do ads to young people, there are only three things that an advertiser can target around: age, gender, location. We also prohibit certain ads to young people, including weight-loss ads. We don’t allow tobacco ads at all [meaning to young people]. We don’t allow them to children. We don’t allow them to minors.”###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:21:34 text: \n",
      "Now, since that exchange happened last week, there are a number of individuals and groups, including a group called the Technology Transparency Project or TTP, that have indicated that that part of her testimony was inaccurate. That it was false. TTP noted that TTP had conducted an experiment just last month, and their goal was to run a series of ads that would be targeted to children ages 13 to 17, to users in the United States. Now, I want to emphasize that TTP didn’t end up running these ads. They stopped them from being distributed to users, but Facebook did in fact approve them. As I understand it, Facebook approved them for an audience of up to 9.1 million users, all of whom were teens.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:22:31 text: \n",
      "I brought a few of these to show you today. This is the first one I wanted to showcase. This first one has a colorful graphic encouraging kids to, “Throw a Skittles party like no other,” which as the graphic indicates, and as the slang jargon also independently suggests, this involves kids getting together randomly to abuse prescription drugs. The second graphic displays an ana tip. That is a tip specifically designed to encourage and promote anorexia. It’s on there. Now the language, the ana tip itself independently promotes that. The ad also promotes it in so far as it was suggesting. These are images you ought to look at when you need motivation to be more anorexic, I guess you could say. Now the third one invites children to find their partner online and to make a love connection. “You look lonely. Find your partner now to make a love connection.”###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:23:38 text: \n",
      "Now look, it’d be an entirely different kettle of fish if this were targeted to an adult audience. It is not. It’s targeted to 13 to 17-year-olds. Now, obviously I don’t support and TTP does not support these messages, particularly when targeted to impressionable children. Again, just to be clear, TTP did not end up pushing the ads out after receiving Facebook’s approval, but it did in fact receive Facebook’s approval. I think this says something. One could argue that it proves that Facebook is allowing and perhaps facilitating the targeting of harmful adult-themed ads to our nation’s children.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:24:23 text: \n",
      "Could you please explain to me, Ms. Haugen, how these ads with a target audience of 13 to 17 year old children, how would they possibly be approved by Facebook, and is AI involved in that?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 01:24:45 text: \n",
      "I did not work directly on the ad approval system. What was resonant for me about your testimony is Facebook has a deep focus on scale. Scale is can we do things very cheaply for a huge number of people, which is probably why they rely on AI so much.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 01:25:03 text: \n",
      "It is very possible that none of those ads were seen by a human. The reality is that we’ve seen from repeated documents within my disclosures is that Facebook’s AI systems only catch a very tiny minority of offending content and best-case scenario in the case of something like hate speech, at most they will ever get 10 to 20%. In the case of children, that means drug paraphernalia ads like that. It’s likely if they rely on computers and not humans, they will also likely never get more than 10 to 20% of those ads.###################\n",

      "While Facebook may claim that it only targets ads based on age, gender, and location, even though these things seem to counteract that, but let’s set that aside for a minute, and that they’re not basing ads based on specific interest categories. Does Facebook still collect interest category data on teenagers, even if they aren’t at that moment targeting ads at teens based on those interest categories?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 01:26:16 text: \n",
      "I think it’s very important to differentiate between what targeting are advertisers allowed to specify and what targeting Facebook may learn for an ad.

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 01:26:31 text: \n",
      "For example, in the case of something about partying, it would learn partying is a concept. I’m very suspicious that personalized ads are still not being delivered to teenagers on Instagram because the algorithms learn correlations. They learn interactions where your party ad may still go to kids interested in partying because Facebook almost certainly has a ranking model in the background that it says this person wants more party-related content.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Mike Lee: time: 01:27:02 text: \n",
      "Interesting. Thank you. That’s very helpful. What that suggests to me is that while they’re saying they’re not targeting teens with those ads, the algorithm might do some of that work for them, which might explain why they collect the data even while claiming that they’re not targeting those ads in that way.###################\n",

Engagement-based ranking, which causes those amplification problems that leads young women from innocuous topics like healthy recipes to anorexia content.

And in reality, the thing asking for is a move from short-termism, which is what Facebook is run under today, right? Is being led by metrics and not led by people. And that with appropriate oversight in some of these constraints, it’s possible that Facebook could actually a much more profitable company five or 10 years down the road because it wasn’t as toxic.

If our focus is protecting the First Amendment and our rights to free speech, while very carefully regulating data privacy, I’ve heard… There are a number of things that are being discussed in Congress.

      "So I think those issues, they’re independent issues. So we can talk about free speech first, which is having more transparency. Like Facebook has solutions today that are not content-based. And I am a strong advocate for non-content based solutions, because those solutions will also then protect the most vulnerable people in the world. In a place like Ethiopia, where they speak six languages, if you have something that focuses on good ideas and bad ideas, those systems don’t work in diverse places. So investing in non content-based ways to slow the platform down, not only protects our freedom of speech, it protects people’s lives.###################\n",

      "The second question is around privacy and it’s a question of how can we have oversight and have privacy? There’s lots and lots of research on how to abstract data sets so you’re not showing people’s names. You might not even be showing the content of their post. You might be showing data that is about the content of their post, but not the post itself. There are many ways to structure these data sets that are privacy conscious, and the fact that Facebook has walled off the ability to see even basic things about how the platform performs, or in the case of their past academic research, releasing inaccurate data, or not being clear about how they pulled that data is just part of a pattern of behavior of Facebook hiding behind walls and operating in the shadows. And they have far too much power in our society to be allowed to continue to operate that way.###################\n",

So, the more information that you can provide to us about how that might work to actually address the problem, I think would be helpful.

Facebook is stuck in a feedback loop that they cannot get out of. They have been hiding this information because they feel trapped, right?

Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality. Reddit is vaguely about ideas. But Instagram is about bodies and about comparing lifestyles. And so, I think there are real questions where Instagram would have to come in and think hard about their product or about, what is their product about?

I strongly support the idea that Facebook should have a year, maybe 18 months, to have private research.

Most people are not well-informed on what the costs, the personal costs of having their data sold are. And so, I worry about pushing that choice back on individual consumers. In terms of should people consent to working with algorithms, I worry that if Facebook is allowed to give users the choice of, do you want to an engagement-based newsfeed or do you want a chronological newsfeed? Like ordered by time, maybe a little spam demotion, that people will choose the more addictive option, that engagement based ranking, even if it is leading their daughters to eating disorders.###################\n",

Some of it’s dark money. Some of it is very overt, but I guess the point I’d like to make to you personally is that your being here really sends a profound message to our nation that one person can really make a difference. One person standing up, speaking out can overcome a lot of those obstacles for us. And you have crystallized, in a way, our consciousness here. You have been a catalyst, I think, for change in a way that we haven’t seen and I’ve been working on these issues for 10, 15 years. And you have raised awareness in a way that I think is very unique. So, thank you not only for your risk-taking and your courage and strength and standing up, but also for the effect that it has had.###################\n",

      "Very rarely do you have one of these generational shifts where the generation that leads, like parents, who guide their children, have such a different set of experiences that they don’t have the context to support their children in a safe way. There is an active need for schools or maybe the national institutes of health to make established information, where if parents want to learn on how they can support their kids, it should be easy for them to know what is constructive and not constructive. Because Facebook’s own research says kids today feel like they are struggling alone with all these issues, because their parents can’t guide them. And one of the things I’m saddest when I look on Twitter is when people blame the parents for these problems with Facebook. They say, “Just take your kid’s phone away.” And the reality is these issues are a lot more complicated than that. And so, we need to support parents because right now, if Facebook won’t protect the kids, we at least need to help the parents to protect the kids.###################\n",

So Facebook is incredibly flat, to the point where they have the largest open floor plan office in the world. It’s a quarter of a mile long and one room, right? They believe in flat. And instead of having internal governance, they have metrics that people try to move. In a world like that, it doesn’t matter that we now have multiple years of data saying MSI may be encouraging bad content, might be making spaces where people are scared, where they are shown information that puts them at risk. It’s so hard to dislodge a ruler like that, that yardstick, that you end up in this situation where, because no one is taking leadership, no one is intentionally designing these systems… It’s just many, many people running in parallel, all moving the metric, that these problems get amplified and amplified and amplified.

      "I spent a number of years as an attorney general, helping to lead litigation against Big Tobacco. And I came to hear from a lot of smokers, how grateful they were, ironically and unexpectedly, that someone was fighting Big Tobacco because they felt they had been victimized as children. They started smoking when they were 7, 8, 12 years old because Big Tobacco was hooking them. And as we develop the research, very methodically and purposefully addicting them at that early age, when they believed that they would make themselves more popular, that they would be cool and hip if they began smoking and then nicotine hooked them. Now, physiologically, nicotine has addictive properties. What is it about Facebook’s tactics of hooking young people that makes it similar to what Big Tobacco has done?###################\n",

They want the next like. The dopamine, the little hits all the time. And I feel a lot of pain for those kids, right? They say they fear being ostracized if they step away from the platform. So imagine you’re in this situation, you’re in this relationship where every time you open the app, it makes you feel worse, but you also fear isolation if you don’t.

      "Ms. Haugen, thank you for your compelling testimony. In that testimony, you discuss how Facebook generates self-harm and self-hate, especially among vulnerable groups like teenage girls. I happen to be a father of four kids, three daughters, two of whom are teenagers. And as you just alluded to, most adults, myself included, have never been a teenager during the age of Facebook, Instagram, and these other social media platforms. And therefore, I think it can be really hard for many of us to fully appreciate the impact that certain posts may have, including, I would add, on a teen’s mental health. So can you discuss the short and long-term consequences of body image issues on these platforms, please?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 02:52:04 text: \n",
      "The patterns that children establish in their teenage years live with them for the rest of their lives. The way they conceptualize who they are, how they conceptualize how they interact with other people, are patterns and habits that they will take with them as they become adults, as they themselves raise children. I’m very scared about the upcoming generation because when you and I interact in person, and I say something mean to you, and I see wince or I see you cry, that makes me less likely to do it the next time, right? That’s a feedback cycle. Online kids don’t get those cues and they learn to be incredibly cruel to each other and they normalize it. And I’m scared of what will their lives look like, where they grow up with the idea that it’s okay to be treated badly by people who allegedly care about them? That’s a scary future.###################\n",

      "One of the things that’s hard… For people who don’t look at the data of social networks every day, it can be hard to conceptualize the distribution patterns of harms, or just of usage. There are these things called power laws. It means that a small number of users are extremely intensely engaged on any given topic and most people are just lightly engaged. When you look at things like misinformation, Facebook knows that the people who are exposed to the most misinformation are people who are recently widowed, divorced, moved to a new city, are isolated in some other way.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 02:53:57 text: \n",
      "When I worked on civic misinformation, we discussed the idea of the misinformation burden. The idea that when people are exposed to ideas that are not true over and over again, it erodes their ability to connect with the community at large, because they no longer adhere to facts that are consensus reality. The fact that Facebook knows that its most vulnerable users, people who recently widowed, that they’re isolated, that the systems that are meant to keep them safe, like demoting misinformation, stop working when people look at 2000 posts a day, right? And it breaks my heart, the idea that these rabbit holes would suck people down and then make it hard to connect with others.###################\n",

      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 02:55:15 text: \n",
      "So as an algorithm specialist, so this is someone who designs, algorithm experiences, I’m actually against the breaking up of Facebook, because even looking inside of just Facebook itself, so not even Facebook and Instagram, you see the problems of engagement based ranking repeat themselves. So, the problems here are about the design of algorithms of AI, and the idea that AI is not intelligent. And if you break up Instagram and Facebook from each other, it’s likely… So I used to work on Pinterest. And the thing that we faced from a business model perspective was that advertisers didn’t want to learn multiple advertising platforms, that they got one platform for Instagram and Facebook and whatever, and learning a second one for Pinterest, Pinterest made radically fewer dollars per user. And when I’m of is, right now, Facebook is the internet for lots of the world. If you go to Africa, the internet is Facebook. If you split Facebook and Instagram apart, it’s likely that most advertising dollars will go to Instagram, and Facebook will continue to be this Frankenstein that is altering that is endangering lives around the world. Only, now there won’t be money to fund it. And so, I think oversight and finding collaborative solutions with Congress is going to be key, because these systems are going to continue to exist and be dangerous, even if broken up.###################\n",

Last week, YouTube announced it was swiftly banning all anti-vaccine misinformation, and I have long called on Facebook to take similar steps. They’ve taken some steps, but do you think they can remove this content and do they put sufficient resources? We know the effect of this. We know that over half the people that haven’t gotten the vaccines it’s because of something that they’ve seen on social media. I know the guy I walked into a cafe and said his mother-in-law wouldn’t get a vaccine because she thought a microchip would be planted in her arm, which is false.

Blumenthal’s been working on this, I’ve long been focused on this eating disorder issue, given the mortality rates.

      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:05:19 text: \n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your incredible leadership on this issue. As early as 2012, Facebook has wanted to allow children under the age of 12 to use this platform. At that time in 2012, I wrote a letter to Facebook asking questions about what data it planned to collect, and whether the company intended to serve targeted ads at children. Now, here we are nine years later, debating the very same issues. Today, Ms. Haugen, you’ve made it abundantly clear why Facebook wants to bring more children onto the platform. It’s to hook them early, just like cigarettes so that they become lifelong users, so Facebook’s profits increase. Yet, we should also ask why in the last nine years as the company not launch Facebook for kids or Instagram for kids? After all, from the testimony here today, Facebook appears to act without regard to any moral code, or any conscience, or instead puts profit above people, profit above all else.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:06:25 text: \n",
      "The reason why Facebook hasn’t officially permitted kids 12 and under to use its platform, is because the Child Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, that the author of exists. Because there is a privacy law on the books, which I authored, that gives the Federal Trade Commission regulatory power to stop websites and social media companies from invading the privacy of our children 12 and under. That’s why we need to expand the Child Online Privacy Protection Act. That’s why we need to pass the Kids Act that Senator Blumenthal and I have introduced, and why we need an Algorithmic Justice Act to pass, because the absence of regulation leads to harming, stoking division, damaging our democracy. That’s what you’ve told us today.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:07:20 text: \n",
      "So Ms. Haugen, I want you to come back to the protections that you are calling on us to enact. This isn’t complicated. We’re going to be told online all day with these paid Facebook people, “Oh, Congress can’t act. They’re not experts. It’s too complicated for Congress. Just get out of the way. You’re not experts.” Well, this isn’t complicated. Facebook and it’s big tech lobbyists are blocking my bills to protect kids because it would them money. That’s how complicated it is. So, let’s start with the Kids Act and send it Blumenthal and I, that would ban influencer marketing to kids. Today’s popular influencers pedal products, while they flaunt their lavish lifestyles to young users. Can you explain how allowing influencer marketing to teens and children makes Facebook more money?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:08:23 text: \n",
      "The business model that provides a great deal of the content on Instagram is one where people produce content for free. They put it on Instagram free, no one’s charged for it, but many of those content creators have sponsorships from brands or from other affiliate programs. Facebook needs those content creators to continue to make content, so that we will view content, and in the process, view more ads. Facebook provides tools to support influencers, who do influencer marketing because it gives them the supply of content that allows them to keep people on the platform, viewing more ads, making more money for them.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:09:05 text: \n",
      "Yeah. So I am actually the author of the 1990 Children’s Television Act. What does that do? Well, it says to all the television networks in America, “Stop praying on children. Stop using all of your power in order to try to get young children in our country, hooked on the products that are going to be sold.” We had to pass a law to ban television stations from doing this. That’s why I knew that after my law passed in 1996, to break up the monopolies of the telecommunications industry and allow in the Googles, and the Facebooks, and all the other companies, you name it, that we would need a child privacy protection there, because everyone would just move over to that new venue. It was pretty obvious, and of course the industry said, “No way, we’re going to have privacy laws for adults.” And they blocked me from putting that on the books in 1996. But at least for children, I got up to age 12. That’s all I could get out of the industry.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:10:08 text: \n",
      "But, we also know that, as time has moved on it, they become even more sophisticated so that the Kids Act is necessary to stop children and teen apps from being features such as likes and follower accounts that quantify popularity. Ms. Haugen, can you explain how allowing these features that create an online popularity contest makes Facebook more money?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:10:42 text: \n",
      "Just to make sure, so, I am only familiar with issues regarding teens from the research I have read of Facebook’s. So I want to put that caveat on there. The research I’ve seen with regard to quantifiable popularity is that, as long as comments are allowed, so this is not a quantitative thing, this is just comments, as long as comments are still on posts on Instagram, just taking likes off Instagram, doesn’t fix the social comparison problem. That teenage girls are smart, they see that Sally is prettier than them, her pictures are really good, she gets tons of comments, they don’t get very many comments. Right? And so, I do think we need larger interventions than just removing quantitative measures.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:11:27 text: \n",
      "Facebook has a product that is very attractive. The reason why they have the study of problematic use is because it is kind of addictive. And those kinds of things, like having lots of little feedback loops, keeps kids engaged. And like I mentioned earlier, part of why Facebook switched over to meaningful social interactions was it found that if you got more likes, more comments, more reshares, you produced more content. And so, having those systems of little rewards, makes people produce more content, which means we view more content, and we view more ads, which makes them more money.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:12:05 text: \n",
      "Okay. And the Kids Act that Senator Blumenthal and I are advocating for also prohibits amplification of dangerous and violent content to children and teens. Can you explain how algorithms pushing that dangerous content makes Facebook more money?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:12:20 text: \n",
      "I don’t think Facebook ever set out to intentionally promote divisive, extreme polarizing content. I do think though, that they are aware of the side effects of the choices they have made around amplification. And they know that algorithmic based ranking, so engagement based ranking, keeps you on their sites longer. You have longer sessions, you show up more often and that makes them more money.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:12:45 text: \n",
      "So do you believe we have to ban all features that quantify popularity as a starting point in legislation?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:12:57 text: \n",
      "As I covered before, the internal research I’ve seen is that removing things like likes alone, if you don’t remove things like comments, doesn’t have a huge impact on social comparison. So I do believe we need to have a more integrated solution for these issues.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:13:10 text: \n",
      "Should we ban targeted advertisements to children?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:13:14 text: \n",
      "I strongly encourage banning and targeted advertisements to children and we need to have oversight in terms of, I think the algorithms will likely still learn the interests of kids, and match ads to those kids, even if the advertiser can’t articulate, they’ll want to target on this interest.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:13:29 text: \n",
      "How much money does Facebook make from targeting children?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:13:33 text: \n",
      "I don’t know what fraction of their revenue comes from children.###################\n",
      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:13:36 text: \n",
      "Okay, so ultimately children are not commodities.###################\n",

      "speaker: Senator Ed Markey: time: 03:13:39 text: \n",
      "They have always been given, historically, special protections. That’s what the Children’s Television Act of 1990 is all about. They have always been given this special safety zone so the children can grow up without being prayed upon by marketers. When I was a boy, and the salesman would knock on the front door, my mother would just say, “Tell them I’m not home. That man is not getting into our living room.” Well, I would say to my mother, “But you are home.” “Not to him,” she would say. Well, we need to give parents the ability just to say, “No one’s home for you, and your company, and your attempts to prey upon children, to get into our living room.” That’s our moment in history. We have to make sure that we respond to the challenge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 03:14:31 text: \n",
      "Thank you Senator Markey. And my thanks to Senator Markey for his leadership over many years on protecting children. As you’ve heard, he was a champion in the House of Representatives before coming here, well before I was in the United States Senate, but around the time I was elected Attorney General. I’ve been very pleased and honored to work with him on legislation now, going forward. And I joined him in thanking you. I have just a few concluding questions, and I seem to be the last one left standing here. So, the good news is I don’t think we’ll have others, but as you may know, you do know, my office created an Instagram user identified as a 13 year old girl. She followed a few easily identifiable accounts on weight loss, dieting, eating disorders. And she was deluged, literally, within a day of content, pushed to her by algorithms that, in effect, promoted self injury and eating disorders. Are you surprised by that fact?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:15:51 text: \n",
      "I’m not surprised by that fact. Facebook has internal research where they have done even more gentle versions of that experiment, where they have started from things like interest in healthy recipes. So not even extreme dieting, and because of the nature of engagement based ranking and amplification of interests that, that imaginary user was pushed, or that real account was pushed towards extreme dieting and pro-anorexia content very rapidly.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 03:16:17 text: \n",
      "And that’s the algorithm?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:16:19 text: \n",
      "That’s the algorithm.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 03:16:21 text: \n",
      "That algorithm could be changed?###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:16:23 text: \n",
      "The algorithm definitely could be changed. I have firsthand experience from having worked at Pinterest. Pinterest used to be an application that was heavily based just on, you follow certain people’s pins, and those are put into your feed. And over time, it grew to be much, much more heavily based on recommendations that the algorithm would figure out, what are you interested in? You can have wonderful experiences that are based on human interactions. So these are human scale technologies, not computers choosing what we focus on.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 03:16:54 text: \n",
      "So, the average parent listening here worried about their daughter or son being deluged with these kinds of content would want that kind of algorithm changed, I would think, and would welcome the oversight that you’re recommending.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:17:14 text: \n",
      "I believe parents deserve more options and more choices. And today they don’t know even what they could be asking for.###################\n",
      "speaker: Mr. Chairman Blumenthal: time: 03:17:21 text: \n",
      "I just received by text, literally about 15 minutes ago, a message from someone in Connecticut. And I’m going to read it to you. It’s from a dad, “I’m in tears right now, watching your interaction with Francis Haugen. My 15 year old daughter loved her body at 14. Was on Instagram constantly, and maybe posting too much. Suddenly, she started hating her body, her body dysmorphia, now anorexia, and was in deep, deep trouble before we found treatment. I fear she’ll never be the same, I’m brokenhearted. I think people tend to lose sight of the real world impact here. And I think that’s the reason that you’re here. I’d just like to invite you, if you have any words to those other employees at big tech, the workers who may be troubled by the misconduct or unethical conduct that they see, what you would tell them.###################\n",
      "speaker: Miss Frances Haugen: time: 03:18:46 text: \n",
      "We live in a pattern that we have seen throughout time with regard to technologies, is that humans are very crafty people; we find interesting solutions, but we often get out over our skis, right? We develop things that are of larger scale than we really know how to handle. And what we have done in the past is, when we see this happen, we take a step back, and we find institutions, and we find frameworks for doing these things in a safe way. We live in a moment where whistleblowers are very important, because these technological systems are walled off. They are very complicated. They’re things that you need to be a specialist to really understand the consequences of. And the fact that we’ve been having the exact same kinds of false choice discussions about what to do about Facebook; is it about privacy or oversight? Is it about censorship or safety? The fact that we’re being asked these false choices is just an illustration of what happens when the real solutions are hidden inside of companies. We need more tech employees to forward through legitimate channels, like the SCC or Congress, to make sure that the public has the information they need, in order to have technologies be human-centric, not computer-centric.###################\n",

In the past weeks and days parents have contacted me with their stories, heartbreaking and spine chilling stories about children pushed into eating disorders, bullying online, self injury of the most disturbing kind, and sometimes even taking their lives because of social media. Parents are holding Facebook accountable because of your bravery, Miss Haugen, And we need to hold accountable Facebook and all big tech as well. Again, my thanks to you.

And as the chairman said, privacy and online privacy, passing a federal privacy standard has been long in the works. I filed my first privacy bill when it was in the House back in 2012, and I think that it will be this Congress and this subcommittee that is going to lead the way to online privacy, data security, section 230 reforms.

And here you go, 66% of teen girls on Instagram and 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparisons, this is Facebook’s research. 52% of teen girls who experience negative social comparison on Instagram said it was caused by images related to beauty. Social comparison is worse on Instagram because it is perceived as real life, but based on celebrity standards. Social comparison mimics the grief cycle and includes a downward emotional spiral, encompassing a range of emotions from jealousy to self proclaimed body dysmorphia. Facebook addiction, which Facebook calls, conveniently, problematic use is most severe in teens peeking at age 14.'},\n",

Allowing users to create multiple accounts that Facebook does not delete and encouraging teens to create second accounts, they can hide from their parents.

And while Ms. Davis says that kids below 13 are not allowed on Facebook or Instagram, we know that they are because she told us that they recently had deleted 600,000 accounts from children under age 13. So how do you get that many underage accounts if you aren’t turning a blind eye to them in the first place. And then in order to try to clean it up, you go to delete it and then you say, “Oh, by the way, we just in the last month deleted 600,000 underage accounts.” And speaking of turning a blind eye, Facebook turns a blind eye to user privacy. News broke yesterday that the private data of over 1.5 billion, that’s right, 1. 5 billion Facebook users is being sold on a hacking forum. That’s its biggest data breach to date.

Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children, for our public safety, our privacy, and for our democracy, and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes. During my time at Facebook, first working as the lead product manager for civic misinformation, and later on counter espionage, I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolve these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats, and more combat.

The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world.

Often large tech companies use either sourcing agencies that will go and identify people who meet certain demographic criteria, or they will reach out directly based on data on the platform.

When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years in my own work. Engagement based ranking, Facebook says, “We can do it safely because we have AI. The artificial intelligence will find the bad content that we know our engagement based ranking is promoting.” They’ve written blog posts on how they know engagement based rankings dangerous, but the AI, I will save us. Facebook’s own research, says they cannot adequately identify dangerous content. And as a result, those dangerous algorithms that they admit are picking up the extreme sentiments, the division. They can’t protect us from the harms that they know exist in their own system. And so I don’t think it’s just a question of saying, should people have the option of choosing to not be manipulated by their algorithms? I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intent ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content, it is pulling families apart. And in places like Ethiopia, it’s literally fanning ethnic violence.

So imagine you’re in this situation, you’re in this relationship where every time you open the app, it makes you feel worse, but you also fear isolation if you don’t. I think there’s a huge opportunity here to make social media that makes kids feel good, not feel bad, and that we have an obligation to our youth to make sure that they’re safe online.'},\n",

In that testimony, you discuss how Facebook generates self-harm and self-hate, especially among vulnerable groups like teenage girls. I happen to be a father of four kids, three daughters, two of whom are teenagers. And as you just alluded to, most adults, myself included, have never been a teenager during the age of Facebook, Instagram, and these other social media platforms.

And if you break up Instagram and Facebook from each other, it’s likely… So I used to work on Pinterest. And the thing that we faced from a business model perspective was that advertisers didn’t want to learn multiple advertising platforms, that they got one platform for Instagram and Facebook and whatever, and learning a second one for Pinterest, Pinterest made radically fewer dollars per user. And when I’m of is, right now, Facebook is the internet for lots of the world. If you go to Africa, the internet is Facebook. If you split Facebook and Instagram apart, it’s likely that most advertising dollars will go to Instagram, and Facebook will continue to be this Frankenstein that is altering that is endangering lives around the world.

They have always been given this special safety zone so the children can grow up without being prayed upon by marketers. When I was a boy, and the salesman would knock on the front door, my mother would just say, “Tell them I’m not home. That man is not getting into our living room.” Well, I would say to my mother, “But you are home.” “Not to him,” she would say. Well, we need to give parents the ability just to say, “No one’s home for you, and your company, and your attempts to prey upon children, to get into our living room.” That’s our moment in history. We have to make sure that we respond to the challenge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.'},\n",

As you’ve heard, he was a champion in the House of Representatives before coming here, well before I was in the United States Senate, but around the time I was elected Attorney General. I’ve been very pleased and honored to work with him on legislation now, going forward. And I joined him in thanking you. I have just a few concluding questions, and I seem to be the last one left standing here. So, the good news is I don’t think we’ll have others, but as you may know, you do know, my office created an Instagram user identified as a 13 year old girl. She followed a few easily identifiable accounts on weight loss, dieting, eating disorders. And she was deluged, literally, within a day of content, pushed to her by algorithms that, in effect, promoted self injury and eating disorders. Are you surprised by that fact?'},\n",

Suddenly, she started hating her body, her body dysmorphia, now anorexia, and was in deep, deep trouble before we found treatment. I fear she’ll never be the same, I’m brokenhearted.

And what we have done in the past is, when we see this happen, we take a step back, and we find institutions, and we find frameworks for doing these things in a safe way. We live in a moment where whistleblowers are very important, because these technological systems are walled off. They are very complicated. They’re things that you need to be a specialist to really understand the consequences of. And the fact that we’ve been having the exact same kinds of false choice discussions about what to do about Facebook; is it about privacy or oversight? Is it about censorship or safety? The fact that we’re being asked these false choices is just an illustration of what happens when the real solutions are hidden inside of companies.

We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as Folger Digital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.\n",

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.\n",

      "      Until now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers in search of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of\n",

      "     <p>\n",
      "      Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created, for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See\n",
