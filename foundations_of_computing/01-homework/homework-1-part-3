1. 
    To download the data in the terminal/command line, I used the command:
    curl -0 https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv

2. How many accidents are in the file?
    To find the number of accidents I used the command 
    wc -l fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv

    And I got the answer: 577

    Then I used the command
    head -n 5 fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv
    to check whether the first couple of rows are accidents or names the columns. It appears that the first two rows are not accidents. 
    Thus, there is 575 accidents in the file. 

3. What command would I use to show me ONLY the first line of the file?
    To show ONLY the first line in a file, I would use the command:

    head -n 1 [filename] or in this case
    head -n 1 fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv    

4. I want to know what companies were involved in falls (e.g. people falling). Can you search the file to only show falls?
    Yes in that case I would use the command
    grep "fall" fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv  
    Then I only get the lines where some version of "fall" appear

5. Creating a file of only 2017 accidents.
    To create a new file that only contains the 2017 accidents I use the command
    grep 2017 fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv > 2017accidents.csv

6. How many accidents involved forklifts?
    I use the grep -c to get the number that matches my search
    grep -c forklift fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv
    There has been 16 accidents involving forklifts

7. How many accidents were on Christmas Eve?
    I use the same command as in 6, but instead of forklift, I just put 12/24
    grep -c 12/24 fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv
    It looks like there has been 2 accidents on christmas eve

8. Creating a text file of accidents that contain only trees
    To do so, I use the command:
    
    grep -w 'tree\|trees' fy17_federal-state_summaries.csv > treeaccidents.txt

    I use the -w to exclude cases where "tree" is included in a longer word e.g., "street". The addition 'word\|words' allows me to ask for 
    both the singular and plural version of the word tree, which added one extra accident to the file.
